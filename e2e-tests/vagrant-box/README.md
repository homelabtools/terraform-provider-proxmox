# proxmox-box

> :+1: This process will eventually be converted to a Packer build, allowing for the box to be published in Vagrant Cloud.

This is a build for creating a Vagrant box that runs Proxmox VE on Debian.
It was created for end-to-end tests for the Proxmox Terraform provider project,
[danitso/terraform-provider-proxmox](https://github.com/danitso/terraform-provider-proxmox).
